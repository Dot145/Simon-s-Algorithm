# Simon's Algorithm
Code for setting up and solving instances of Simon's Problem using IBM Quantum computers.

## How can I use this?
Feel free to download the Jupyter notebook in this repository and modify it to perform experiments with your own parameters. You can try different *n* values or different functions with *a* values other than those I've used, or you could modify the `build_noise_circuit` function to introduce new types of noise.
